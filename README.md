# Natural Disasters Tracker

A fullstack web application made in Next.js that leverages the NASA EONET API to provide a map of natural events across the world. The map itself is generated using the [google-maps-react-markers](https://github.com/giorgiabosello/google-maps-react-markers) library.

The application is available at [https://natevents.vercel.app](https://natevents.vercel.app).
